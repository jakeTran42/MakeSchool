# Adding WebSockets with Socket.io

## Competencies & Objectives

1. Identify the use cases for WebSockets
1. Explain the difference between HTTP and WebSocket standards and communication
1. Implement the simplest possible WebSocket event-driven communication in our spec project.

## Intro

So far in our exploration of web patterns we've always used HTTP to make synchronous, call-and-response type requests to servers. But what happens when you want clients and servers to communicate asynchronously as in a chat application or with live updates or streaming information. As of a few years ago, a powerful new standard called *WebSockets*.

In the following tutorial we'll be using [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) one of the most reliable npm modules on the web that enables node servers to respond to event-driven WebSocket behaviors. Socket.io is a broad and powerful library that can manage multiple channels, rooms, and manage https and other forms of security. In our case we will be implementing a simple asynchronous push of data from the server to the client.

Remember that since the client and the server are communicating via WebSockets, Socket.io will have a client- and server-side library you will need to initialize in your project. A simple example is as follows:

```html
<!-- CLIENT -->
<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
<script>
  var socket = io('http://localhost');

  socket.emit('ferret', 'tobi', function (data) {
    console.log(data); // data will be 'woot'
  });
</script>
```

```js
// SERVER
var io = require('socket.io-client')('http://localhost');
io.on('connection', function (socket) {
  socket.on('ferret', function (name, fn) {
    fn('woot');
  });
});
```

## Baseline Challenges

1. Imagine you are working for a pet rescue and they want their website to update what each pet is doing when they do it.
1. Create a project called `pet-store` with the express generator.
1. Add a Pet resource with new, create, show routes.
1. Add socket.io and get a "hello world" working of websocket connections.
1. Make the server update the client on the pets#show page with either: 1) eating, 2) bathing, 3) sleeping, or 4) playing. Implement WebSockets so that a pet's status is updated on their show page randomly every 10 seconds.

## Stretch Challenges

1. Make it so that on the pets#index page the pets' statuses are also updated at random.
