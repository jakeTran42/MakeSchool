# Navigating React projects

React projects are Single Page Applications or SPAs. These are 
applications written in JavaScript that exist as a single web page
loaded in a browser but, display as multi-page site. 

Navigation between different content elements is the act of 
displaying components. Components can define different "pages" of 
content.

React Router manages this navigation and display of components.
