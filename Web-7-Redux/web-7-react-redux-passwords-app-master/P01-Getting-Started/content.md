# Getting Started 

The goal of this section is to install the tools you will need to complete the tutorial. 

## Editor - Atom

You will need a code editor of some kind. I will recomend using Atom. You can download 
it for free [here](https://atom.io).

## Command Line Tools NPM

Node package Manager is a tool for managing file dependancies. Follow the instructions 
[here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) and install the version for your computer system. 

You'll use NPM to build and run your project and download and manage project dependancies.
