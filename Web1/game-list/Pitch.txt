Problem today:

Hello! Im sure many of us here play video games. Well how well do you keep
tracks of all your video game? How do you know which one to recommend
to your friends or family? There is just way too many gamese nowaday
from different platforms to keep track of. Well my app call Game List
can help solve your problems. 

In today's world, there are very little way to keep track of your games.
One way is to use steam and have an extensive library for games you may
have bought but never play. Theres are also other platform like PS4
or Xbox that you cannot keep track of. 

Well my app is an easy to use app that you can add any type of game
across platform to your own personal list and even rate or comment
on what game made an impact on you. There are multiple resources 
such as having a master game list and you can add in your favorite games,
completed games and on-hold games.

The three three benefits of using my web app is:

1. Easy to use
2. Cross platforms
3. Personalized setting
