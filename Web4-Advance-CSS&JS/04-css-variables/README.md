# CSS Variables 

CSS variables are amazing. This is a new feature that has pretty coverage
at this time. Variables let you do things that were not possible before 
with CSS. They expand the possibilites and techniques you can bring to 
your web projects. They also give you a great new tool to improve your 
coding practice allowing you to make your code DRY and improve separation
of concerns. 

No, really, CSS varaibles are amazeballs!

## CSS Variables 

Define a variable with: 

`--var-name: value;`

Names begin with `--`, I know this looks weird. 

Access a variable's value with: 

`var()`

For example: 

`var(--var-name)`
