# Introduction - CSS

CSS is a language that describes the appearance of elements in 
a web page. 

CSS has evolved into a highly sophisticated system with an amazing 
range of control over visual properties. 

Why is this considered so advanced? The level of abstraction 
used to create a system that supports a very clear and deliberate 
separation of concerns. CSS allows you to describe, in the utmost 
detail, how a page appears in isolation of the structure 
and logic. 

When creating web sites, if you are using the system to your 
best advantage, you should be able to change the appearance 
of your web project by editing the CSS. 

With this class I have two goals. 

1. Students will be able to draw anything they can imagine in the browser.
2. Students will understand the separation of concerns and use it to their best advantage. 

## Competencies 

Following the material and completing the assignments students 
will be able to:

- Create objects in a range of objects
  - With any color or shape
- Solve positioning problems
  - Position Objects anywhere with pixel precision
- Transform objects via rotation, scale, skew, and translate

## Web art

You can draw anyting using CSS. CSS provides an amazing range of
tools for controlling the appearance of what is drawn in the 
browser. 

Challenge yourself to make any shape you can imagine using the 
tools provided in the CSS langauge. 

By doing this you will learn the CSS language and broaden your 
ability to create anything you can imagine. 

This is series of daily coding challenges. 

- Challenge - create one CSS drawing each day for 5 days. 
  - Alternate: Create 10 simple drawings every day for 5 days. 
- Stretch Challenge - Create one CSS drawing every day for 7 days. 
  - Alternate: Create 10 simple drawings every day for 7 days. 
  
### Principals of design

Art and design is something you can work at for your entire life. 
Here are principals of design that you can learn in a few minutes and 
apply to your work. 

- **Positive and Negative Space** - Positive and Negative space refers to 
the main elements in a design and the space around them. 
- **Balance** - Balance is the most dificult feature of design to work 
with. Balance is the idea arranging elements so the positive and 
negative space work together so that one doesn't over power the other. 
You can look at elements on the page as having different visual weight.
Arranging the visual space so things feel right is balance. 
Balance can take different forms. 
  - Symetrical 
  - Asymetrical 
  - Radial 
- **Contrast** - Contrast is difference between elements that make them 
standout strongly against each other. It applies to color shape, size
and any other features. 
- **Emphasis** - Ephasis is the idea of making an element more visually 
dominant. 
- **Movement** - Movement is the idea of arranging elements in a way to 
lead a viewers eye around the page. 
- **Repetition** - Repetition manifests as visual patterns that repeat. 
- **Rhythm** - Rhythm is the creation of visual movement. Like Repetition
Rhythm has patterns, unlike repitition Rhythmic patterns evolve and 
change. 
- **Unity** - Unity is the idea putting things together that people 
expect to find together. 
- **Variety** - Variety is the idea of including the unexpected in your 
design.

### Abstract your classes (stretch challenge)

You'll notice that many of the rules you are writing use the 
same properties and values. Abstract your styles into descriptive 
classes. 

Think about how you can use class names to define generic rules
that apply in many cases. For example:

```CSS
.round {
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

### Clip Path (stretch challenge)

Use `clip-path`
